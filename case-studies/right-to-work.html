      <h1 class="display-4">Giving control to job applicants</h1>

    <p>A digital service to help people prove they have the right to work in the UK.</p>
  </div>

            <div class="content">
              <h3 class="project-title">Background</h3>
              <p>
                By law, employers must check everyone they employ has the right to work in the UK. This can involve a bewildering number of visa documents, often adorned with cryptic remarks about the type of work or number of hours a person can do.
              </p>
              <p>
                Job applicants also find the process unnerving. They have to trust prospective employers with their visa and identity documents. Sometimes with little or no knowledge about what an employer will do with their personal information.
              </p>
              <h3 class="project-title">Doing the hard work to make things easy</h3>
              <p>
                Working in a multidisciplinary agile team, I designed an online service for job applicants to view their visa information and share it with employers. By interviewing a range of employers and job applicants, we found that:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>small employers often struggled to do right to work checks</li>
                <li>job applicants often weren’t aware of their visa work restrictions</li>
              </ul>
              <p>These insights help form our design approach – to put job applicants in control. The service would let applicants decide who to share their information with.
              </p>
              <div class="image">
                  <img class="image news-item" width="75%" src="../images/share work info 4.png" alt="A screenshot of the ‘share your work information’ step on the prove your right to work service."/>
              </div>


              <p>
                One challenge was finding the right language to use for a user group of largely non-native English speakers. To keep the service secure, employers could only view a job applicant's information using a unique access code. But user testing showed that this process wasn’t intuitive to job applicants.
              </p>
              <p>
                Working with the team's interaction designer, I simplified the user journey so that job applicants would not need to handle the code. Instead, the code would be automatically generated and emailed directly to an employer with instructions on how to use it.
              </p>


              <h3 class="project-title">Result</h3>
              <p>
                The service passed its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-standard-reports/prove-your-right-to-work-beta">digital service assessment</a> on all points in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard">GOV.UK Service Standard</a>.
